\profile{I work at the intersection of data science, causal inference, and applied economics. I love solving problems, learning, teaching, and writing beautiful code to build reliable infrastructure to analyse data at scale. My technical skills are complemented by an ability to move fluently between the abstract and the concrete, take both a scientific and a business perspective, and see the essence of problems, which helps me understand them deeply, solve them effectively, and communicate them clearly. I also enjoy driving initiatives, managing projects, and ensuring that the right things are done right.}
